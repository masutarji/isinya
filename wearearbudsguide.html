<li>Select the wing tip size that best fits your ear.</li>
<li>Hold the wing tip for the left or right ear in one hand, and the corresponding earbud in the other.</li>
<li>Hook the wing tip&rsquo;s groove to the earbud&rsquo;s fixation hook on one side and gently pull the wing tip to cover the earbud. Do not pull the wing tip excessively when you attach or detach it because it may tear.</li>
<li>Follow the same procedure for the other earbud.</li>

<li>Select the right or left earbud, and insert the lower half (with the speakers) into the bottom part of the corresponding ear.</li>
<li>Tuck the top half of the earbud (with the wing tip)&Acirc; in the upper part of your ear. Adjust for a comfortable fit. The touch-sensitive sensor will detect that you are wearing the earbuds when you put them on and emit a sound.</li>
</ol>
<h5><span id="coupling_earbuds">Coupling Earbuds</span></h5>
<p>Should you lose one of the earbuds, you can buy a replacement and couple the old and new earbuds together.</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert the earbuds into the charging case. The earbud battery indicator light will flash red to indicate that the earbuds are not coupled.</li>
</ol>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Tap and hold the touch area on both earbuds for seven seconds or more. When the earbud batter indicator light flashes green and then turns off, the earbuds are coupled and ready for use.<br /><br /><br /></h5>
